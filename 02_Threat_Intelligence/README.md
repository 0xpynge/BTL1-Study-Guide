# üí° Threat Intelligence (CTI)

> This section explores the field of **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**. The goal is to understand how to gather, analyze, and apply knowledge about adversaries, their motivations, and their methods (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures - `TTPs`) to make more informed and proactive defense decisions.
>
> We move from simply reacting to events to understanding the context behind them, using OSINT tools and frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ**.

## üó∫Ô∏è Section Contents

* **[Key Concepts](./01_Key_Concepts.md):** Defines what CTI is, Indicators of Compromise (`IoCs`) vs. `TTPs`, types of intelligence, the intelligence lifecycle, and the Pyramid of Pain.
* **[MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Framework](./02_MITRE_ATTACK.md):** Explains in detail the structure (Tactics, Techniques, Sub-techniques), usefulness, and how to use this essential framework.
* **[Key Tools](./03_Tools.md):** Presents public and OSINT tools for investigating `IoCs` (VirusTotal, OTX, AbuseIPDB, URLScan, WHOIS, DNS/PDNS, Shodan...).
* **[IoC Investigation Workflow](./04_IoC_Workflow.md):** Proposes a step-by-step workflow for analyzing different types of indicators (IPs, domains, hashes, URLs) using CTI.
* **[Resources and Practice](./05_Practice_Resources.md):** Offers links to CTI blogs, data platforms, and other resources to deepen knowledge and practice.
