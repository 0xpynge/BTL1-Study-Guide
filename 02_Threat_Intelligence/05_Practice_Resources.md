# ðŸ“š Resources and Practice for Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Threat Intelligence is a vast and constantly evolving field. Staying updated and practicing analysis is fundamental. Here are some resources to continue learning:

## ðŸ“š Frameworks and Knowledge Bases

* **[MITRE ATT&CKÂ®](https://attack.mitre.org/)**:
    * The fundamental resource. Explore the tactics, techniques, actor groups, software, and mitigations. Read the descriptions and examples.

## ðŸ“° Blogs and Research Reports (Essential)

> Reading analyses of real campaigns conducted by experts is one of the best ways to learn. Follow blogs from leading CTI and security companies:

* **[Mandiant Blog (Google Cloud)](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence)**
* **[CrowdStrike Blog](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/)**
* **[Recorded Future Blog](https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog)**
* **[Kaspersky Securelist / GReAT](https://securelist.com/)**
* **[Microsoft Security Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/)**
* **[Cisco Talos Intelligence Blog](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/)**
* **[Palo Alto Networks - Unit 42 Blog](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/)**
* **[SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC)](https://isc.sans.edu/)**: Daily reports and short analyses.

**Security News Sites (often cover CTI reports):**

* **[The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/)**
* **[Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/)**
* **[Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)** (More focused on cybercrime and investigations)

## ðŸ“Š Data Platforms and Communities

* **[OTX (AlienVault Open Threat Exchange)](https://otx.alienvault.com/)**:
    * Explore "Pulses" created by the community to see how `IoCs` are grouped and contextualized in real investigations.

* **abuse.ch Resources:**
    * **[MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/)**: Database of malware samples. Useful for obtaining hashes and samples (**with caution!**) often with CTI context (tags, families).
    * **[Feodo Tracker](https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/)**: Tracks C2 infrastructure of specific banking trojans (Emotet, Dridex, etc.). Useful for obtaining active C2 IPs and domains.
    * **[URLhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/)**: (Already mentioned) Database of malware distribution URLs.

* **[MISP Project](https://www.misp-project.org/)**:
    * Explore the concept and look for public MISP instances or OSINT feeds that share data in MISP format. Helps understand how CTI is formally structured and shared.

* **Twitter / X:**
    * An invaluable (but noisy) source of near real-time CTI. Follow security researchers, CTI companies, and relevant hashtags like `#ThreatIntel`, `#CTI`, `#DFIR`, `#Malware`, `#OSINT`.

## ðŸŽ“ Training and Further Reading

* **[SANS CTI Resources](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/threat-intelligence/)**: SANS offers high-quality (paid) CTI courses but also publishes many free resources (webcasts, posters, whitepapers) in their Reading Room.
* **Books:** Look for books on "Cyber Threat Intelligence" or "Intelligence-Driven Incident Response" to delve deeper into methodologies.

## ðŸ’» Practice Platforms (Reiteration)

* **[CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)** and **[Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO)](https://blueteamlabs.online/)**: Many of their challenges require using CTI techniques to pivot between `IoCs`, understand the attack context, and answer questions about the adversary or campaign.
