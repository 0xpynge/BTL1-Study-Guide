# üìä SIEM Analysis (Security Information and Event Management)

> This section is dedicated to **SIEM Analysis**, a fundamental discipline in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). We will explore what a SIEM is, its key functions, and how to use it to investigate security events by analyzing centralized logs.
>
> We will focus especially on **`Splunk`** as an example SIEM platform, given that it is widely used and relevant for scenarios like BTL1.
