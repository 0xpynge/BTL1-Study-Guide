# Suggested Workflow for Phishing Analysis

Having a structured process helps analyze suspicious emails efficiently, safely, and without forgetting important steps. This is a general workflow you can adapt depending on the case and available tools.

**Safety First!** Always perform these steps in a controlled environment (analysis VM) and avoid directly interacting with potentially malicious elements on your main machine. If possible, work with the email as a file (`.eml` or `.msg`).

<details>
<summary><strong>üõ°Ô∏è Step 1: Preparation and Safety</strong></summary>
<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure you are in your <strong>isolated analysis environment</strong>.</li>
        <li>Have your analysis tools handy (secure browser, access to online services, terminal).</li>
        <li>Obtain the suspicious email as a file (<code>.eml</code>/<code>.msg</code>) if possible, to preserve the complete headers.</li>
    </ul>

<br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sender:</strong> Do you recognize the address? Does the display name match the actual address?</li>
        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> Is it generic, alarming, unexpected? Does it contain errors?</li>
        <li><strong>Tone and Content:</strong> Read the body looking for urgency, threats, bad grammar, generic greetings, strange requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Links (Hover):</strong> Hover the cursor <strong>without clicking</strong> over the links. Does the URL shown in the browser/email client status bar match the link text? Does it look suspicious?</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Verify Path:</strong> Follow the <code>Received:</code> headers from bottom to top to identify the actual source IP.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze IP Reputation:</strong> Check the source IP in services like AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, OTX.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Authentication:</strong> Pay special attention to the <code>SPF</code>, <code>DKIM</code>, and <code>DMARC</code> results. Failures here are strong indicators of <code>spoofing</code>.</li>

        <li><strong>Check Reputation:</strong> Look up each URL/domain in VirusTotal, URLhaus, OTX.</li>
        <li><strong>Expand Shorteners:</strong> Use a URL expander if you find short links (<code>bit.ly</code>, etc.) and analyze the final URL.</li>
        <li><strong>Preview with Sandboxing:</strong> Submit suspicious URLs to URLScan.io to see a screenshot and analysis of the destination page without visiting it directly. You can use Any.Run or Triage for deeper interaction if needed.</li>

    * Have your analysis tools handy (secure browser, access to online services, terminal).
    * Obtain the suspicious email as a file (`.eml`/`.msg`) if possible, to preserve the complete headers.

2.  **Initial Assessment (Visual - No Clicks):**
    * **Sender:** Do you recognize the address? Does the display name match the actual address?
    * **Subject:** Is it generic, alarming, unexpected? Does it contain errors?
    * **Tone and Content:** Read the body looking for urgency, threats, bad grammar, generic greetings, strange requests.
    * **Links (Hover):** Hover the cursor **without clicking** over the links. Does the URL shown in the browser/email client status bar match the link text? Does it look suspicious?

3.  **Header Analysis (`Headers`):**
    * Extract the full email headers.
    * Paste them into a header analyzer (MxToolbox, Google Messageheader).
    * **Verify Path:** Follow the `Received:` headers from bottom to top to identify the actual source IP.
    * **Analyze IP Reputation:** Check the source IP in services like AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, OTX.
    * **Review Authentication:** Pay special attention to the `SPF`, `DKIM`, and `DMARC` results. Failures here are strong indicators of `spoofing`.
    * **Compare `From:`, `Reply-To:`, `Return-Path:`:** Are they different? Do they point to suspicious domains?

4.  **Detailed Analysis of the Message Body:**
    * Look for specific social engineering techniques (e.g., pretexting, baiting).
    * Identify any requests for sensitive information (credentials, personal, financial data).
    * Extract all mentioned URLs for the next step.

5.  **URL Analysis (Safe Mode):**

    * **Calculate Hashes:** Obtain the MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the file (see `03_Commands_Cheatsheet.md`).
    * **Check Hash Reputation:** Look up the hashes in VirusTotal and OTX. This is often enough to identify known malware.
