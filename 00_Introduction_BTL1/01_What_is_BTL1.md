# What is the BTL1 (Blue Team Level 1) Certification?

The **Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1)** certification, offered by [Security Blue Team](https://securityblue.team/), is a **fundamentally practical** validation of the essential skills required for entry-level cyber defense roles. Unlike purely theoretical certifications, BTL1 is designed to demonstrate that a candidate can **perform real tasks** within a Security Operations Center (SOC) or an incident response team.

## üõ°Ô∏è The Focus: Active and Practical Defense

The core of BTL1 lies in its **100% practical approach**. It's not about memorizing abstract concepts, but about applying knowledge and tools in simulated scenarios that mimic real-world security incidents. Candidates must investigate, analyze, and respond using industry-standard tools within a virtual lab environment.

* **Defense vs. Attack:** Clearly positioned in the "Blue Team", it focuses on detection, protection, and response, contrasting with "Red Team" certifications focused on attack simulation (pentesting).
* **Skills Validation:** Demonstrates proficiency in crucial tasks such as phishing analysis, SIEM alert investigation, basic disk and memory forensics, and network traffic analysis.

## üéØ Who is it For? (Target Audience)

BTL1 is ideal for:

* **Students and recent graduates** looking to enter the defensive cybersecurity field.
* **IT or systems professionals** wanting to pivot towards security roles.
* **`SOC` Analysts Tier 1** or similar roles seeking to validate and certify their practical skills.
* **Anyone interested** in acquiring a solid and practical foundation in defensive security operations.

> _Although it's a Level 1 certification, a basic understanding of networking, operating systems (Windows/Linux), and fundamental security concepts is assumed._

## üíº Value in the Industry

The BTL1 certification has quickly gained recognition for its practical and realistic approach. Employers value BTL1 because it:

* **Demonstrates Practical Ability:** Ensures the candidate can "do the job" from day one.
* **Covers In-Demand Skills:** The assessed areas (Forensics, `SIEM`, `IR`, Phishing) are essential in `SOC` and incident response roles.
* **Effective Screening:** Serves as a good indicator of a candidate's practical aptitude for defensive roles.

## üìù Exam Format

The BTL1 exam is known for being challenging yet fair, simulating the pressure and tasks of a real incident:

* **Duration:** 24 full hours to perform the investigation and complete the report.
* **Environment:** Access to a virtual lab environment with multiple virtual machines (Windows, Linux, `SIEM`, etc.) and pre-installed tools.
* **Task:** A complex incident scenario is presented, requiring investigation across different domains (logs, network, memory, disk).
* **Deliverable:** A detailed report documenting findings, analysis, conclusions, and answers to specific scenario questions. **The report is a crucial part of the assessment.**

## üìö Knowledge Areas Covered

BTL1 assesses practical proficiency in the following main domains (each is detailed in its corresponding section of this guide):

1.  **Phishing Analysis:** Identification and dissection of malicious emails.
2.  **Threat Intelligence:** Contextualizing attacks and actors.
3.  **Digital Forensics:** Analysis of disk artifacts and memory dumps.
4.  **`SIEM` Analysis:** Investigation of events and alerts on platforms like `Splunk`.
5.  **Network Analysis:** Examination of traffic captures (`PCAPs`) with `Wireshark`/`tshark`.
6.  **Incident Response:** Basic analysis techniques on live systems.
