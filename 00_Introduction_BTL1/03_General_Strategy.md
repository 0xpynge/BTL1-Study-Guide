# General Strategy for the BTL1 Exam

The BTL1 exam is a 24-hour marathon that tests not only your technical skills but also your endurance, organization, and time management ability. Having a clear strategy can make a big difference.

## <0xF0><0x9F><0xA7><0xB2> Preparation (Previous Days) 
* **Familiarize Yourself with the Platform:** If Security Blue Team offers information or demos about the exam interface, review it so you don't waste time on D-day.
* **Confirm Your Tools:** Make sure you feel comfortable with the key tools (Volatility, Splunk, Wireshark, etc.). It's not the time to learn a tool from scratch.
* **Prepare Your Environment:** Have your workspace ready, ensure you have a good internet connection, and minimize potential distractions.

## ‚è±Ô∏è The First Hours: Reading and Planning

* **Read the Scenario (Thoroughly!):** Read the scenario document several times. Make sure you understand:
    * The general context of the incident.
    * The specific objectives of the investigation (what you are asked to find).
    * The format and requirements of the final report.
* **Initial Reconnaissance:** Take a quick first look at the provided environment (virtual machines, initial files) to get a general idea.
* **Plan (Draft):** Sketch out an initial plan of attack. Where will you start? Which domains seem most relevant according to the scenario? Be flexible, this plan can change.

## ‚è≥ Time Management: The Clock is Key

* **24 Hours Are Not Infinite:** Allocate approximate time blocks to investigate different areas or answer sections of the report.
* **Avoid "Rabbit Holes":** It's easy to get lost investigating an unimportant detail. If you spend a long time on something without clear progress, **mark it, document it, and move on**. You can come back later if necessary.
* **Prioritize:** Focus on tasks that directly address the scenario's objectives.
* **Time for the Report:** Reserve enough time at the end (or do it as you go) to write and review the report!

## üìù Effective Note-Taking: Your Best Ally

* **Document EVERYTHING:** It's **CRUCIAL**. Don't rely on your memory. Write down:
    * Exact commands you execute.
    * Important results (IPs, hashes, filenames, timestamps, suspicious users).
    * Key file paths.
    * Hypotheses you are considering.
    * Steps you follow.
    * Relevant screenshots (check the exam rules about this!).
* **Choose a Tool and Be Organized:** Use a note-taking application (CherryTree, Obsidian, Notion, KeepNote, OneNote, or even a well-structured text editor). Organize your notes by machine, by task, by finding, or however seems most logical to you.
* **Notes = Future Report:** Think of good notes as the raw material for your final report. They will save you a huge amount of time when writing.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Report Writing

* **Don't Leave It Until the End:** Try to fill in sections of the report as you confirm findings. It's easier to write about something when it's fresh.
* **Answer Everything:** Make sure to address each and every question or requirement posed in the scenario.
* **Clarity and Evidence:** Be clear in your explanations and back up every conclusion with the evidence you have collected (according to the exam guidelines).

## üßò Breaks and Well-being

* **Plan Short Breaks:** Get up, stretch your legs, rest your eyes every so often. It will help you maintain concentration.
* **Hydrate and Eat:** Have water and healthy food handy. Avoid heavy meals that make you sleepy.
* **Sleep if Necessary:** It's a long test. If you feel exhaustion is blocking you, a short nap (if your schedule allows) can be more productive than continuing to fight against extreme fatigue.

## üí™ Mindset During the Exam

* **Stay Calm:** There will be moments of frustration or blockage. Take a deep breath and remember your preparation.
* **Be Methodical:** Follow your plan (flexibly) and your investigation methodology.
* **Trust Your Skills:** You have studied and practiced. Apply what you know.
* **Don't Give Up:** If something doesn't work, try something else. Persistence is key.
