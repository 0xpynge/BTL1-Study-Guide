## 🎯 My Result & The **GOLD COIN TIP** 🪙

Here's a crucial piece of advice based on my own experience:

* I initially passed with a score of **80%**.
* Knowing the "Gold Coin" is awarded for 90%+, and feeling I might have been close or that some points were potentially missed in grading, I **requested a manual review** (a standard option offered by Security Blue Team).
* **Surprise!** After the review, my score was adjusted to **90%**, earning me the coveted **BTL1 Gold Coin!** ✨ *(Proof Screenshot included in original post/can be added)*

> **🔥 MY STRONGEST ADVICE:** If you pass but feel your score is close to a boundary (especially the 90% for Gold) or believe points might have been overlooked – **DO request a manual review!** It might make a significant difference. Be patient, though; the review process can take time.

* *(Side Note: The physical coin itself took about 5 months to arrive after earning it – manage expectations on delivery times!)*
