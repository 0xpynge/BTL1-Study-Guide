# ðŸ”¥ Incident Response (IR)

> **Incident Response (IR)** is the organized and structured approach an organization follows to manage the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack. The main objective is to **limit damage**, **reduce recovery time and costs**, and **learn from the incident** to improve future security posture.

A security incident can be any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems or data.

## ðŸ“„ Importance of Incident Response

An effective IR plan and capability are crucial for:

* **Minimizing Impact:** Quickly containing the breach to prevent it from spreading and causing more damage.
* **Restoring Operations:** Recovering affected systems and services quickly and safely.
* **Meeting Requirements:** Satisfying legal, regulatory, or contractual obligations for breach notification and management.
* **Protecting Reputation:** Managing communication and the crisis to maintain the trust of customers and stakeholders.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Learning from each incident to strengthen defenses and prevent similar future attacks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Relationship with BTL1

> BTL1 exam scenarios typically simulate the initial phases of an incident response process, primarily **Identification** and **Analysis**. You are presented with a situation (SIEM alert, reported phishing email, detected strange behavior) and you must use your analysis skills (forensics, logs, network) to investigate:
> * What happened?
> * Which systems are affected?
> * What is the initial scope?
> * What actions did the attacker take?
> * Are there indicators of compromise (`IoCs`)?

Although in BTL1 you generally won't perform real-time containment or eradication actions on the exam systems, you _will_ apply investigation techniques characteristic of IR. The **Live Response** commands we will see in this section are a fundamental part of the initial collection of volatile data during a real incident response. Understanding the complete IR lifecycle will give context to your analysis.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure of this Section

In this section, we will cover:

1.  **[The Incident Response Lifecycle](./01_IR_Lifecycle.md):** Standard models like `PICERL` or `NIST IR`.
2.  **[Live Response on Windows](./02_Live_Response_Windows.md):** Commands for collecting initial volatile information on Windows systems.
3.  **[Live Response on Linux](./03_Live_Response_Linux.md):** Equivalent commands for Linux systems.
4.  **[Containment and Eradication (Concepts)](./04_Containment_Eradication.md):** Basic strategies (though not directly applied in BTL1).
5.  **[Resources and Practice](./05_Practice_Resources.md):** Where to practice `IR` scenarios.
