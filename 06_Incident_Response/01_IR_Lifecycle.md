# 🔄 The Incident Response Lifecycle (PICERL)

> To effectively manage security incidents, organizations typically follow a **structured lifecycle**. This ensures that appropriate measures are taken consistently and comprehensively. One of the most recognized models is the **`PICERL`** acronym, representing six key phases (similar to the NIST SP 800-61 cycle).

## The 6 Phases of the PICERL Cycle

### 🛠️ 1. Preparation (`Preparation`)

* **Objective:** Ensure the organization is ready to respond **before** an incident occurs. It is an ongoing phase.
* **Typical Activities:**
    * Develop and maintain **incident response plans (`IRP`)** and **playbooks** for specific scenarios.
    * Train and equip the **Incident Response Team (`CSIRT`/`CERT`)**.
    * Acquire and configure necessary tools (`SIEM`, `EDR`, Forensics, `IDS`/`IPS`, etc.).
    * Establish communication and escalation procedures.
    * Conduct security assessments, system hardening, and vulnerability patching.
    * Carry out security awareness training for users.

### 🔍 2. Identification (`Identification`)

* **Objective:** Detect the occurrence of a security incident, determine its initial nature, and assess its potential scope and impact.
* **Typical Activities:**
    * Monitor alerts from security tools (`SIEM`, `EDR`, `AV`, `IDS`/`IPS`).
    * Analyze logs from various sources.
    * Investigate user reports or detected anomalies.
    * Perform **initial triage** to confirm if it's a benign event or a real incident.
    * Gather initial evidence (respecting the order of volatility).
    * **Note:** Analysis tasks in **BTL1** primarily fall within this phase.

### 🧱 3. Containment (`Containment`)

* **Objective:** Limit the incident's impact and **prevent it from spreading** to other systems or networks. It's a critical and often urgent phase.
* **Typical Activities:**
    * **Isolation:** Disconnect affected systems from the network (logically or physically).
    * **Blocking:** Disable compromised user accounts, block malicious IPs/domains in firewalls/proxies.
    * **Segmentation:** Limit connectivity between different network segments.
    * **Strategies:** There might be short-term containment (stop the bleeding) and long-term containment (prepare clean systems for recovery).

### 🔥 4. Eradication (`Eradication`)

* **Objective:** Completely eliminate the **root cause** of the incident and all malicious artifacts from the affected environment.
* **Typical Activities:**
    * Remove malware and attacker tools.
    * Remove unauthorized accounts or backdoors.
    * Patch exploited vulnerabilities.
    * Ensure the attacker no longer has access to the environment.
    * Often involves **re-imaging or rebuilding** affected systems from a clean image and verified backups.

### ✅ 5. Recovery (`Recovery`)

* **Objective:** Restore affected systems and services to their normal operating state safely and efficiently.
* **Typical Activities:**
    * Restore data from clean backups.
    * Bring rebuilt or cleaned systems back into production.
    * Perform thorough testing to ensure functionality and security.
    * **Intensively monitor** recovered systems for any signs of residual activity or re-infection.
    * May be a gradual or phased restoration.

### 🎓 6. Lessons Learned (`Lessons Learned`)

* **Objective:** Analyze the incident and the response given to identify what worked well, what could have been done better, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. Crucial for continuous improvement.
* **Typical Activities:**
    * Post-incident meeting with all involved parties.
    * Preparation of a detailed final incident report.
    * Root cause analysis.
    * Identification of gaps in controls, policies, or procedures.
    * **Update plans, playbooks, security configurations, and user training** based on lessons learned.
    * Share relevant information (anonymously if necessary) with the community.

## 🔄 Cyclical Nature

> It's important to remember this is a **cycle**: lessons learned feed back into the preparation phase, improving future response capabilities. Furthermore, in complex incidents, phases may overlap or iterate.
