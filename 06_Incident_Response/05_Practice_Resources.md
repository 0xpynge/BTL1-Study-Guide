# 📚 Resources and Practice for Incident Response (IR)

> Incident Response is where all the pieces of defensive analysis (forensics, logs, network, CTI) come together. Practicing with complete scenarios is the best way to develop the necessary intuition and efficiency.

## 💻 Platforms with IR Scenarios

These platforms offer challenges and labs that simulate security incidents from start to finish or key phases of the response:

* **[CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)**:
    * **Highly Recommended.** Many of their challenges are complete `DFIR` scenarios where you are given logs, memory dumps, disk images, network traffic, etc., and must investigate a complete incident.

* **[Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO)](https://blueteamlabs.online/)**:
    * Especially their "Investigation" scenarios, which are longer and more complex than the daily "Challenges". They usually require multiple types of analysis to solve the case.

* **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)**:
    * Look for learning paths like "Cyber Defense" or specific rooms tagged with "Incident Response", "`DFIR`", "Threat Hunting".

* **[Hack The Box - Sherlocks](https://app.hackthebox.com/sherlocks)**:
    * Specific `DFIR`/Blue Team challenges simulating complex investigations.

* **[RangeForce](https://www.rangeforce.com/) / [Immersive Labs](https://www.immersivelabs.com/) (Mention - Commercial):**
    * These are enterprise training platforms offering highly realistic `IR` simulations, often used by organizations to train their `SOC`/`CSIRT` teams. Less accessible for free individual practice.

* **Annual Events (SANS):**
    * **SANS NetWars:** CTF-style competition with many `IR` components.
    * **SANS Holiday Hack Challenge:** Free annual event around Christmas, often with excellent forensic and `IR` challenges. Materials sometimes remain available afterward.

## 📖 Fundamental Guides and Methodologies

> Understanding standard frameworks is important:

* **[NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-61/rev-2/final)**:
    * The NIST reference guide for incident handling. Fundamental reading.

* **[SANS DFIR Resources](https://www.sans.org/digital-forensics-incident-response/)**:
    * SANS offers free posters, cheatsheets, whitepapers, and webcasts on `IR` and forensics in their "Reading Room" and blog.

* **Books:** Look for titles on "Incident Response", "Incident Handling", "Applied Incident Response" to delve deeper into methodologies.

## 📰 Blogs and Real Incident Write-ups

> Learning from real cases (even if anonymized) is invaluable:

* **Vendor Incident Response Reports:** Search the blogs and resource sections of companies like Mandiant (Google Cloud), CrowdStrike, Kroll, Sophos, Secureworks, etc. They often publish detailed analyses of campaigns and observed `TTPs`.
* **`CSIRT`/`CERT` Team Blogs:** Some teams publish analyses or lessons learned.
* **CTF Write-ups:** Read how others solved `IR` challenges on platforms like **CyberDefenders** after they conclude.

## 🛠️ Tools (Integration)

> Remember that `IR` practice involves **jointly** using all the tools and techniques seen in previous sections:

* **`SIEM`** (`Splunk`, `Elastic`...) for log analysis.
* **Forensic Tools** (`Autopsy`, `Volatility`, EZ Tools, `TSK`...) for disk and memory.
* **Network Analyzers** (`Wireshark`, `tshark`...) for `PCAPs`.
* **Live Response Commands** (Windows and Linux).
* **CTI Tools** (`VirusTotal`, `OTX`...) for enriching `IoCs`.
