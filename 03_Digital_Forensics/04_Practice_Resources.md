# 📚 Resources and Practice for Digital Forensics (DFIR)

> Digital forensics is an eminently practical discipline. The best way to consolidate knowledge is by analyzing real images and memory dumps or from challenges designed for it.

## 💾 Forensic Images and Practice Challenges

* **[Digital Corpora](https://digitalcorpora.org/)**:
    * A public repository of disk images, memory dumps, network traffic, and other datasets designed for forensic education and research. Excellent source of diverse material.

* **[CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/)**:
    * Leading platform for CTF challenges focused on Blue Team and DFIR. They offer free and paid challenges covering disk, memory, network, and log analysis, often based on realistic scenarios. **Highly recommended.**

* **[Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO)](https://blueteamlabs.online/)**:
    * Focused on defensive skills. Their challenges ("Challenges" and "Investigation" scenarios) frequently require disk and/or memory forensic analysis to solve them.

* **[Volatility Memory Samples Wiki](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Memory-Samples)**:
    * The official Volatility Foundation wiki links to several public memory images that you can use to practice with the tool and test different plugins.

* **aboutDFIR - Challenges:**
    * The site [aboutDFIR.com](https://aboutdfir.com/challenges/) (by Andrew Rathbun) often lists or links to publicly available DFIR challenges.

* **NIST CFReDS (Computer Forensics Reference Data Sets):**
    * [https://cfreds.nist.gov/](https://cfreds.nist.gov/) - Reference datasets, some somewhat old but conceptually useful.

* **General Search:** Search for terms like `"DFIR challenge"`, `"memory forensics ctf"`, `"disk forensics practice images"` to find more resources.

## 💻 Lab and CTF Platforms

Besides DFIR-specific ones, other platforms include forensic tasks:

* **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)**: Contains rooms and learning paths on DFIR, malware analysis, and use of specific tools like **Volatility** or **Autopsy**.
* **[Hack The Box - Sherlocks](https://app.hackthebox.com/sherlocks)**: Specific HTB section dedicated to forensic investigation and incident response challenges (Blue Team).

## 🛠️ Tool Documentation

> The official documentation is your best friend for mastering the tools:

* **[Autopsy Docs & Training](https://docs.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/)**
* **[The Sleuth Kit (TSK) Wiki & Docs](https://wiki.sleuthkit.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)**
* **[Eric Zimmerman's Tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/)** (Documentation usually comes with each tool or on his blog)
* **[Volatility Foundation GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki)** (Essential for understanding V2/V3 plugins and options!)
* **[KAPE Documentation](https://www.kroll.com/en/insights/publications/cyber/kape-documentation)** (And the Kroll blog about its use)
* **[ExifTool Main Page & Tag Names](https://exiftool.org/)**
